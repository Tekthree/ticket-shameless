# Project Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the cleanup performed on April 6, 2025.

## Files Organized

### 1. SQL Admin Files
- Moved redundant admin SQL files to `supabase/admin/deprecated/`
- Kept only `make-admin-fixed.sql` in the main directory
- Added a README.md explaining the cleanup

### 2. Profile/Auth Scripts
- Moved redundant scripts to `scripts/deprecated/`
  - `create-profiles-table.js` (superseded by setup-profiles-manually.js)
  - `fix-profiles.js` (functionality covered in apply-auth-fixes.js)
- Added a BACKUP-README.md explaining these changes

### 3. MCP Directories
- Moved placeholder MCP directories to `deprecated-modules/`
  - `mcp-stripe`
  - `mcp-supabase`
- Added a README.md explaining these directories

## Future Considerations

1. **MCP Implementation**
   - If MCP functionality is needed, implement these modules properly
   - Move them back to the root directory once fully implemented

2. **Improving Documentation**
   - Consider further consolidating documentation in the docs folder
   - Update the main README.md with clearer project structure

3. **Script Consolidation**
   - Further review the scripts directory for more consolidation opportunities
   - Consider implementing a more robust script management system

## Best Practices Going Forward

1. Avoid creating multiple versions of files with similar names (e.g., make-admin, make-admin-simple)
2. Document the purpose of each file in comments or README files
3. Use the migration system consistently for all database changes
4. Regularly clean up deprecated code to avoid accumulation of technical debt
