# Issue Fixes Documentation

This document outlines the changes made to fix several issues in the Ticket Shameless platform.

## 1. Navigation Menu Visibility Issue

**Problem:** The admin dashboard links were visible to all users in the navbar, even those without admin permissions. While the middleware correctly prevented access to the admin dashboard, the UI wasn't properly filtering these links based on user roles.

**Solution:** Updated the `Navbar.tsx` component to check user roles before displaying admin dashboard links:

- Added `useUserRoles` hook to Navbar component
- Conditionally rendered dashboard links based on user roles
- Changed "Admin" link to "Dashboard" for better clarity
- Added role checks: `isAdmin()`, `isEventManager()`, `isBoxOffice()`, `isArtist()`

## 2. Ticket Purchase Database Issue

**Problem:** When purchasing tickets via Stripe, the purchase was successful but not properly recorded in the database. Also, the user's ticket history wasn't showing purchased tickets.

**Solution:** Updated the Stripe webhook handler to:

1. Directly connect orders to user accounts:
   - Added a `user_id` column to the orders table
   - Updated webhook handler to look up user by email
   - Linked orders to user profiles when possible

2. Fixed order record retrieval in the TicketHistory component:
   - Modified TicketHistory.tsx to search for orders by both email and user_id
   - Added fallback query to ensure orders are found regardless of how they were created
   - Normalized status checks to handle case differences ('complete' vs 'completed')

## 3. Ticket Inventory Issue

**Problem:** Events were not properly marking as "sold out" after the last ticket was purchased. The ticket inventory wasn't updating correctly from the webhook.

**Solution:** Improved the ticket inventory update process in the webhook handler:

1. Added direct ticket inventory management:
   - Replaced the indirect decrement function with explicit ticket counting
   - Added logic to directly fetch current tickets remaining
   - Explicitly set the sold_out flag when tickets reach zero
   - Added better error handling and logging

## 4. Database Schema Improvements

**Problem:** The database schema needed updates to accommodate the fixes.

**Solution:** Created database migration system and schema updates:

1. Added proper migrations support:
   - Created migrations directory and SQL files
   - Added migration run script to automatically apply database changes
   - Updated the README to document migration procedures

2. Added new database functions and RLS policies:
   - Created exec_sql function for migrations
   - Updated RLS policies for the orders table
   - Added new policies to allow users to see their own orders

## How to Apply These Fixes

1. Pull the latest code changes
2. Run the database updates:
   ```bash
   # First, run the migrations to update the database schema
   npm run migrate
   
   # Alternatively, manually run the SQL file in Supabase's SQL editor
   # supabase/update-orders-table.sql
   ```
3. Restart the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Testing the Fixes

1. **Navigation Fix**: Log in as a customer and verify admin links are hidden.
2. **Ticket Purchase Fix**: Purchase a ticket and verify it appears in your profile's ticket history.
3. **Inventory Fix**: Purchase the last ticket for an event and verify it changes to "Sold Out".

## Future Improvements

1. Implement a more robust role-based access control system in the UI
2. Add more comprehensive webhook error handling
3. Enhance the order tracking system with email notifications
4. Add detailed logging for debugging purchase issues
