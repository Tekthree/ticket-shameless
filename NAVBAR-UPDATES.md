# Navbar User Profile Updates

This document outlines the changes made to the navigation system to create a more modern and organized user profile interface.

## Changes Made

1. **Added User Profile Card Dropdown**
   - Created a new dropdown menu in the top right corner that contains all user-related actions
   - Displays the user's avatar with a dropdown menu for profile actions
   - Consolidates Profile, Dashboard, and Sign Out buttons into a cleaner interface

2. **New Components**
   - `UserProfileCard.tsx`: A new component that handles the dropdown menu and user profile display
   - `useUserProfile.ts`: A new hook that fetches the user's profile information including avatar

3. **Enhanced Mobile Experience**
   - Updated the mobile menu to match the same options as the desktop dropdown
   - Improved styling and organization for mobile navigation

4. **Profile Picture Handling**
   - Fixed aspect ratio issues in the user avatar component
   - Implemented proper image handling with object-cover to prevent distortion

## Benefits

- **Cleaner Navigation**: Reduces clutter in the main navigation bar
- **Better Organization**: Groups all user-related actions in one logical location
- **Consistent UX**: Provides a consistent interface on both desktop and mobile
- **Modern Design**: Follows contemporary web app design patterns for user profile navigation

## File Changes

- `components/Navbar.tsx`: Updated to use UserProfileCard instead of individual buttons
- `components/UserProfileCard.tsx`: New component for the dropdown profile menu
- `hooks/useUserProfile.ts`: New hook to retrieve user profile details
- `components/ui/avatar.tsx`: Fixed to handle images properly with object-cover
- Removed `components/SignOutButton.tsx` as its functionality is now integrated into UserProfileCard

## How It Works

When a user is logged in:
- The UserProfileCard shows their profile picture (or initials if no picture)
- Clicking the avatar shows a dropdown with profile options and sign out
- Admin users see additional options for accessing dashboard areas

When a user is not logged in:
- A simple "Login" button is shown instead of the profile dropdown

## Further Improvements

Potential future enhancements could include:
- Adding theme preferences to the dropdown
- Including notification indicators
- Adding quick links to recent ticket purchases
- Implementing role-specific quick actions based on user permissions
