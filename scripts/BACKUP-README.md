# Backup of Redundant Scripts

This directory contains backups of scripts that have been superseded by improved versions:

1. `create-profiles-table.js` - Superseded by `setup-profiles-manually.js` (more comprehensive)
2. `fix-profiles.js` - Functionality now covered in `apply-auth-fixes.js`

These files are kept for reference purposes but should not be used in the active workflow.
