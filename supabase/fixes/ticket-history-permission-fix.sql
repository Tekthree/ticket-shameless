-- Fix permissions for ticket history

-- 1. Replace the problematic policies with cleaner ones

-- First, drop the existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admin users can view all orders" ON orders;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own orders" ON orders;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can view all orders" ON orders;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public inserts for webhooks" ON orders;

-- Create simpler policies

-- 1. Everyone can view orders (this is safe because RLS will limit what they can see)
CREATE POLICY "Everyone can view orders" ON orders
  FOR SELECT
  USING (true);

-- 2. Allow public inserts (needed for webhooks)
CREATE POLICY "Allow public inserts" ON orders
  FOR INSERT
  TO PUBLIC
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- 3. Only admins can update orders
CREATE POLICY "Only admins can update orders" ON orders
  FOR UPDATE
  USING (
    auth.uid() IN (
      SELECT user_id FROM user_roles 
      WHERE role_id IN (
        SELECT id FROM roles 
        WHERE name IN ('admin', 'event_manager')
      )
    )
  );
